# Squirrely Pop

## Defend your Home! Kill the Squirrels!

In Squirrely Pop, you play as a Jimmy the Fish trying to defend his home from the evil squirrels who are intent on destroying it.

Go around and attack the squirrels and, inspired by tower defense games, place coral to act as shields around your home. Good luck!
